During our testing, it was very tedius to test/debug having to set host/port 
every time. There is a command line flag to stringServer and stringClient to 
allow server to publish hostport to public_html directory. 
This is enabled if there are 2 command line arg to server and client 
(any 2 arbitrary string).
